v0.0.1 Init

At this point just Go Tour completed briefly + few chapters from Get Programming with Go book

In earliest versions of planner, all Go files will live under one 'main' package intentionally. Need to check codebase limitations, when there is only one package.

- upgrade to Go 1.21.1
- drop Makefile
- init structure
- add tentative API for SLOTs
- add custom mini-router (support for http methods and path-variables using Trie)
